# Supply Chain Efficiency Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain efficiency by analyzing various operational metrics such as lead time, inventory levels, manufacturing costs, and transportation modes. The goal is to identify areas where improvements can be made to reduce costs and delivery times while enhancing overall efficiency.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes 100 records with 24 features, covering various elements of the supply chain such as:
- Product details (type, SKU, price, availability)
- Sales data (number of products sold, revenue generated)
- Inventory and shipping information (stock levels, lead times, shipping costs)
- Supplier and manufacturing details (supplier name, manufacturing costs, defect rates)


## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Ploty
- **Jupyter Notebook**
  
## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to understand the current state of the supply chain.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Proposing actionable insights and strategies to improve efficiency based on the analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate key findings and support data-driven decision-making.

The donut chart reveals that Road transport has the highest defect rate (33.4%), with Rail, Air, and Sea following in descending order.


### Key Findings
- **Manufacturing Costs**: The average manufacturing cost across all products is $47.27, with some significant outliers.
- **Shipping Carriers**: Carrier B is the most frequently used shipping carrier, which may suggest a preference based on cost or reliability.
- **Defect Rates**: The defect rate varies significantly across products, indicating a need for stricter quality control for certain items.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights several areas where the supply chain can be optimized. By addressing the high manufacturing costs for certain products, negotiating better rates with shipping carriers, and improving quality control to reduce defect rates, the overall efficiency of the supply chain can be enhanced.

## Next Steps
- **Implement Optimization Strategies**: Apply the insights gained from the analysis to make data-driven decisions in the supply chain.
- **Monitor Performance**: Continuously track the impact of these changes to ensure ongoing improvement.
- **Expand Analysis**: Consider additional factors like supplier lead times and customer satisfaction to further refine the supply chain.
