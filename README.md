# Supply Chain Efficiency Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing supply chain efficiency using data-driven insights. The goal is to analyze supply chain data to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for potential cost reduction. By leveraging these insights, the project aims to enhance overall supply chain performance, ensuring timely delivery of products, reducing operational costs, and improving customer satisfaction.

## Key Objectives

- Identify key areas where delays and inefficiencies occur.
- Provide recommendations for optimizing inventory management to reduce holding costs while avoiding stockouts.
- Develop strategies for improving demand forecasting to better align supply with actual market needs.
- Analyze transportation costs and suggest methods for minimizing expenses without compromising service quality.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a supply chain dataset, which includes Product type	SKU	Price	Availability	Number of products sold,	Revenue generated,Customer demographics,	Stock levels,	Lead times,	Order quantities,	Shipping times,	Shipping carriers,	Shipping costs,	Supplier name,	Location,	Lead time,	Production volumes,	Manufacturing lead time,	Manufacturing costs,	Inspection results,	Defect rates,	Transportation modes and 	Routes	Costs


## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Ploty
- **Jupyter Notebook**
  
## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to understand the current state of the supply chain.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Proposing actionable insights and strategies to improve efficiency based on the analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate key findings and support data-driven decision-making.
